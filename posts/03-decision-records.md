Are you documenting your important decisions?

What is a decision record?

A decision record represents a snapshot in time when an important decision was made. The goal is to capture the relevant information at the time a decision was made, alternatives that were considered, and so on. Why is that important? 

How to write a decision record?

Rather than fighting to keep docs from going out of date (a task that can never end), assume from the start that nobody will ever update them.

I think, when possible, having the whole team write it together would be best.
Write it up when the decision is fresh. If possible, write it while you're making the decision. Writing may HELP you make a better decision!
Don't spend a lot of time, 30-60 mins is plenty!

There are many templates online (google `architecture decision record template`) which work great! I think the important things to capture are
* Context (why do you need to make a decision?)
* Details about each option considered (you did consider more than one option, right?)
* The decision itself (what are we going to do?)
* The reasoning (what made the choice the best one?)

How does a decision record make your team more successful?
* A way for the team to collectively own their decision, prevent disagreements
* A form of documentation that never goes out of date
* A stronger foundation for future decisions
* Can potentially reduce code churn
